# Task 
1) Study the code in the Main.java file. The program processes information about customers and ordered products and is able to execute the commands: add, print and done.

2) Complete the program with the sum command. If the user enters the sum command, the program must enter the customer identifier and output the total price of the corresponding customer order. If there is no customer with the entered identifier, then output the message "unknown customer".

3) Supplement the program with the command inc. If the user enters the inc command, the program must enter the customer identifier and the product name, and then increase by one the quantity of the product entered. The case where several goods have the same name is not allowed to be processed. If there is no customer with the entered identifier, then the message "unknown client" is output. If there is no product with the entered name, output the message 'not found'.

4) Supplement the program with the command del. If the user enters the del command, the program must enter the customer identifier and the product name, then delete the specified product from the orders of the corresponding customer. The case where several products have the same name is not allowed to be processed. If there is no customer with the entered identifier, the message "unknown client" is output. If there is no product with the entered name, output the message "not found"

5) Convert the Name, Price, Quantity fields of the Item class to private fields. If necessary, add methods to the Item class to handle private fields.

Special requirements for the program:
- At the beginning of the program, place a comment containing information about the program developer (student's name, certificate number, group number).
- Input errors are not allowed.
